Unlocking Insights from Clinical Data: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Clinical Text Classification


Healthcare Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis using SpaCy, CountVectorizer, NLTK, Word Embedding with non-sequence and sequence modelling and sundry
Deep learning, NLP, and machine learning methods have shown considerable promise in several healthcare applications. From the clinical text, NER algorithms can automatically recognise and extract crucial information including patient names, medical conditions, and prescription names. Medical reports, diagnoses, and treatment plans can be organised into specified classifications using clinical text classification algorithms, which can help healthcare professionals make decisions. Healthcare workers now leverage the use of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning techniques to analyse and comprehend the enormous volumes of textual data included in electronic health records (EHRs).

Text analysis and processing jobs heavily rely on the two well-known Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries SpaCy and NLTK. Each library has special benefits and features that add to the total value of using them in NLP applications. To get a complete code check out my GitHub

Problem Understanding
At the heart of any project, it’s paramount that a thorough understanding of the underlying issue and the data itself is at the core of each data science endeavour.

In this clinical text classification, the aim is to predict medical speciality from medical transcription, a data visualization on medical speciality and medical speciality detection. Ride with me on this awesome adventure. shall we?

2. Understanding the Data

every problem needs a solution, but you can’t know the solution if you don’t identify the challenge and understand the date.

As stated earlier, the date for this project is an open-source clinical text dataset downloaded from Kaggle. kindly download the data (mtsaples.csv) and take a walk with me. ensure you load your packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and sundry
